	In the Java test, the candidate has to implement two algorithms to solve a graph problem.
	For an unbalanced graph, the candidate shall compute common nearest ancestors as well as some attributes for nodes.

	Finally, the algorithm shall be exposed via a REST API.
	This is a good test to check problem-solving capabilities as well as testing and code structure.
	>> Default maximum time for the candidate to solve the test: 48 hours
	>> Default time window the candidate can start the test: 7 days

	1. a graph problem
	2. two algorithms
	3. compute:
		- common nearest ancestors (stramosii cei mai apropiati comuni)
		- as well as some attributes for nodes


	TODO: find problems with unbalanced Graph


	TODO: crate REST API infrastructure
	TODO: debug lambdas

	Questions:
	- what is balanced graph

	- what is unbalanced graph


	Algorithms:
	- convert unbalanced to balanced: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-normal-bst-balanced-bst/
